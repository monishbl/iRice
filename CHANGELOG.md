# iRice changelog

## Cooler, safer updates, and fixes · 2026-10-28

**Battery and heat**
- Fixed: the screen-sharing detector kept a CPU core busy, and every shell restart left another copy running, which made the laptop hot. It now costs almost nothing, and nothing iRice starts in the background outlives the shell any more. A new shell also ends anything an earlier one left behind.
- Lighter background checks for the camera, location and file copies.
- Stage Manager previews pause when hidden and are capped at 5 frames a second. A live wallpaper pauses when the screen is locked or idle.
- The island's music bars and heat ripples redraw less often, and pause when hidden or locked. The ripples stop entirely during Cool-down.
- The whole shell now idles below 1% of one core.

**Software Update**
- Only one update runs at a time, across every iRice session.
- A failed iRice update puts everything back exactly as it was, your own changes included.
- Package lists from an update are checked as plain text and never run. Only valid package names reach pacman.
- AUR updates are now a choice in the plan (off by default), because AUR packages are built from user-submitted scripts.
- Once your password is accepted, a system update can't be cut off halfway by the shell restarting or closing.

**Fixes**
- The microphone stays muted after a recording if you muted it during one: fixed.
- Discarding two recordings in a row left the first file behind: fixed.
- The Today screen could open at 4 AM if you were still at your desk, and then not in the morning: it now waits for your next login or unlock.
- A removed Today widget no longer comes back after a restart.
- A display-connect animation could replay when another screen's finished: fixed.
- Clipboard times were missing after a restart until the next copy: fixed.
- Green and orange accents get dark text on their buttons, for contrast.
- Quit leaves apps alone when it can't tell whether a "Save changes?" window is open.

## Today, a smarter accent, and apps that behave · 2026-10-28

**Today**
- On your first unlock after 4 AM, a glass panel greets you with today's events, your to-dos and the weather (now, high and low, rain, and the next hours), with a rising chime timed to the animation.
- Choose how it appears (Bloom, Shrink or Drop) and whether it shows every morning, as a desktop widget, both, or not at all: Settings → Desktop & Widgets → Today.
- **Pin for today** keeps it on the desktop until midnight. Set the name it greets you by in Settings → About.

**Accent colour**
- Your accent is used where it reads, a lighter shade of it on dark backgrounds when needed, and neutral otherwise. It's never darkened, so yellow no longer turns brown.
- Control Center looks like macOS: an "on" button is a white circle with the icon in your accent, or in near-black when the accent can't be read on white.
- Desktop widgets (clock, calendar, reminders, Screen Time, stocks) use your accent.

**Desktop calendar**
- The Calendar widget now works like Notification Center's: the month with busy days, Month and Week views, quick add, and a To-do tab where you can add, rename, tick off and delete (with Undo).

**Clipboard (Super+V)**
- Grouped by when you copied things: Just now, hours ago, Yesterday, weekdays, then dates.
- Bigger image previews, and a two-column grid on the Images tab.
- Fixed: the panel could be empty again after an update restarted the shell.

**Battery**
- The battery menu shows battery health (maximum capacity, condition, and cycle count when reported) and how much power is going in or out.
- Point at the battery for its charge, time left and energy mode.

**Glass and icons**
- New glass optics in Settings → Appearance → Glass → Advanced…: index of refraction, refraction width and dispersion, with a live preview.
- Clear and Tinted app icons are see-through glass tiles with one-tone logos that read evenly across apps; Tinted colours them with your accent.

**Apps and windows**
- Apps no longer open maximized over everything; allow it per app in Settings → Windows.
- Menus and dropdowns in apps like Claude and Webex stay open when you move the pointer.
- Webex shows its own name and icon. Quit now ends apps that keep running in the tray.

**Fixes**
- Sliders no longer scroll the page when your pointer drifts while dragging.
- Brightness and volume icons match the rest of Control Center.
- The island's status row shows system stats only; your events moved to Today.

## The update screen waits for your desktop · 2026-10-28

**Fixes**
- After an update, the screen could go black for a few seconds before your wallpaper and menu bar came back. The update screen now stays until your desktop has drawn, then fades out over it.
- Clicking the update screen while it works does nothing.

## One update for everything, a screen recorder, iOS-style Control Center · 2026-10-28

**Software Update**
- One **Update** button now updates your system and iRice together, in a safe order:
  1. a snapshot first, if snapper or Timeshift is set up;
  2. your system (`pacman -Syu`), with the packages iRice needs;
  3. AUR packages, if you use yay or paru;
  4. iRice itself, rebuilt for the Hyprland you now have.
- Your password is asked in iRice's own dialog. No terminal opens, and the update keeps going if you close Settings.
- **Show details** shows the full output while it runs. The island shows progress.
- Nothing is checked on its own any more. Press **Check for updates** when you want to.
- If Arch has a newer Hyprland than iRice is tested with, you choose each time: keep the current one for now, or update anyway.
- These notes, and a list of the packages each update touches.

**Screen recording**
- Press Super+Shift+5, or Record in Control Center, to open a recording bar: Entire screen, Window or Selected region.
- Options: a microphone (pick which one), system audio, the mouse pointer, and a 3 or 5 second countdown.
- While recording, the island shows the time with Stop. Open it for Pause, Mic mute with a level meter, and Discard (8 s to undo).
- Recordings are saved to `~/Videos/Screen Recordings` as MP4 at 60 fps. Change this in Settings → Desktop & Widgets → Screen recording.
- Uses [gpu-screen-recorder](https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder/about/), which encodes on the graphics card. Without it iRice falls back to wf-recorder: no pause, one audio source.

**Control Center**
- Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and the other wide controls are pills. When on, the button turns white with a coloured icon.
- Square tiles like Now Playing use iOS rounding, with continuous corners.
- Brightness and volume are capsules without labels. In Edit Controls, choose wide or tall for each.
- CPU & Memory opens a page with graphs of the last minute, in four rows: processor and temperature, graphics, memory and swap, and network down and up.
- A speed test, in the Wi-Fi menu and in Settings → Network.

**Menu bar and island**
- The battery is drawn like iOS 27: a solid capsule, red when low, yellow in power saver, with a bolt or plug when charging. Show the percentage inside it, beside it, or not at all in Settings → Menu Bar.
- Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and the Control Center icon match it.
- Privacy dots are only for the microphone, camera and location. Screen sharing is detected from the actual stream and shown in the island or as a dot, your choice, with **Stop sharing**.
- Spaces with windows show as short pills, empty ones as dots. With more spaces than shown, choose arrows or dots that shrink and fade at the ends.
- 18 more menu icons to choose from, in Settings → Appearance.

**Displays**
- Plugging in a display plays a short animation from the side it's on: Extend (a soft, blurred wipe), Liquid (a drop that grows to fill the screen) or Warp.
- An optional sound comes from that side. Try them in Settings → Displays.

**Windows and spaces**
- New windows open tiled or floating, your choice, with exceptions per app in Settings → Windows. Dialogs always float, and switching rearranges what's open.
- A macOS-style Overview: a strip of your spaces on top and search in the middle. The space wallpaper is now a setting, off by default.
- Live window previews are capped at 30 frames a second, and only when Live is chosen. Mission Control and Stage Manager follow the same setting.

**Settings**
- Grouped like System Settings, with a toolbar (back, forward, and where you are).
- Long pages open subpages, like Appearance → Glass.
- Search stays at the top, folds to a magnifier when you scroll, and ends when you click anywhere else.

**Look**
- Glass surfaces have continuous (squircle) corners. The dock is a rounded rectangle, with a slider for the space between icons.
- Clear and tinted icons lift each logo off its tile, with a contrast slider.

**Fixes**
- The clipboard panel was empty in the iRice login session. It now shows your history.
- The screen-sharing dot no longer flickers when iRice draws its own window previews.

## Spaces you can reorder, and a tap of Super opens Overview · 2026-10-28

**Spaces**
- With more spaces than **Spaces always shown**, the menu bar shows a window of them with arrows at the ends. A dot under an arrow means a space past it has windows.
- Drag a space in Overview or Mission Control to put it somewhere else. Its windows move with it.

**Keyboard**
- A tap of Super on its own opens Overview. Super held with another key works as before.

**Dock**
- The dock is a wide glass slab with softly rounded corners and more room around the icons, like macOS Tahoe.
